 * P6 — apartment data
 *
 * GENERATED FROM THE ARCHITECT'S FLOOR PLANS (1np.pdf, "2 az 4 np.pdf", 5np.pdf,
 * Ing. arch. Martin Krajči, podklad arch. Kullman). Room areas are the values
 * printed on those drawings; nothing here is invented.
 *
 * Per the architect's note, kitchen and living room are merged into a single
 * figure, and in one-room flats the entrance area is merged in as well —
 * the spaces run into one another and are not separated by walls.
 *
 * ⚠️  AREAS ARE INDICATIVE. The building is an existing skeleton being
 *     reconstructed; deviations of roughly ±5–10 cm are possible, which moves
 *     the areas. Balcony areas are not final. The investor reserves the right
 *     to changes. Keep the disclaimer visible wherever these numbers appear.
 *
 * STILL TO COME FROM THE CLIENT — do not invent:
 *   price        currently null everywhere -> renders "Cena na vyžiadanie"
 *   status       everything is "dostupny"; update as units get reserved/sold
 *   orientation  needs a site plan with a north arrow; the field, the filter
 *                and the compass were removed rather than guessed
 *   parking, cellars, standard of finish
 *
 *   id        "2.A"  floor + apartment letter, as labelled on the drawings
 *   floor     1-5    nadzemné podlažie
 *   letter    A-I    apartment within the floor (1.NP has no I — lobby)
 *   plan      per-apartment SVG cut from the architect's vector PDF

 *   ext       balcony m²
